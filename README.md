# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions in credit card data.

## Introduction
Credit card fraud poses a significant threat to both consumers and businesses. This project addresses this issue by leveraging machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions and mitigate financial losses. The dataset used for training and evaluation contains labeled transactions, categorizing each transaction as either fraudulent or legitimate.

## Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
Model Training: Utilizes various machine learning models such as logistic regression, random forest, or XGBoost.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage
Prepare Dataset: Replace the sample dataset with your own credit card transaction data.
Preprocessing: Execute the preprocessing script to clean and preprocess the data.
Model Training: Train the model using the provided scripts or your preferred machine learning algorithm.
Model Evaluation: Assess the trained model's performance using the provided evaluation scripts or custom metrics.

## Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
